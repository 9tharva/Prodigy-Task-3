Project Title: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

Description:
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains customer information such as age, job type, marital status, education level, and previous campaign interactions. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training, the project aims to uncover patterns that influence purchase decisions.

Key Features:
Data Source: Bank Marketing dataset
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling
EDA: Visualizing customer demographics, campaign responses, and correlations
Model: Decision Tree Classifier with hyperparameter tuning
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Outcome:
A predictive model that assists in identifying potential customers likely to purchase a product or service, helping businesses optimize marketing strategies.

Tech Stack:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
